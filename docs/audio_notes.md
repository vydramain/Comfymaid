# Audio Notes: Boss Theme Recording (Guitar)

## Core Problem
Recording aggressive guitar with the same setup as pleasant acoustic will sound weak or muddy. The amp sounds good in the room, but the mic captures raw, harsh midrange without room smoothing.

## Practical Fixes
### Amp Settings (start here)
- Gain: 30-40%
- Bass: 30-40%
- Mid: 60-70%
- Treble: 40-50%
- Presence: minimum

If it feels too dry, it is correct. Aggression is added after recording.

### Mic Placement (Blue Yeti X)
- Mode: Cardioid
- Distance: 5-8 cm from speaker
- Aim: between center and edge of the cone
- Angle: 10-20 degrees off-axis

Never point directly at the center. That creates harsh fizz.

### Recording Level
- Amp volume: louder than casual, not rehearsal loud
- Audacity peaks around -12 dB
- Avoid clipping

### Minimal Post Chain (Audacity)
1) High-pass filter: 80-100 Hz
2) EQ cut: -3 to -5 dB @ 250-400 Hz (mud)
3) EQ boost: +2 dB @ 1.6-2.5 kHz (attack)
4) If harsh: -2 dB @ 6-8 kHz
5) Compressor: ratio 3:1, attack 10-20 ms, release 100 ms

### Double Tracking (Mandatory)
- Record the same part twice
- Pan left/right ±60-80
- Do not copy/paste the same take

## Boss Theme Writing Tips
- Fewer notes, more rhythmic pressure
- Use rests as impact
- Avoid solo-like lines; think functional loop

## Emergency Plan
If the amp recording still sounds bad:
- Record clean DI
- Add distortion later (even basic plugins)

A poor digital distortion can be better than a badly mic’d amp.
